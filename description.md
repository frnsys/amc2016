"Community Technology and Independent Media" Track


Technology is not neutral; many tools shapes a lot of the organizing and journalism that we do, online and offline.  Open News is a Knight-Mozilla organization that has been trying to help journalism thrives on the open web.  We are building an ecosystem of tools and programs to strengthen and support the community of developers and journalists in newsrooms. Through workshops, talks, dialogues, skill sharing and relationship building we aim to help understand how the ecosystem of free software works. We all will understand how we can contribute to it and strategies for how to appropriate technology, critical analysis of the tools we use and who owns them. We also want to create a space to explore privacy and security in our organizations and personal lives.
We'll bring together community media organizers, journalists, developers to share their experiences and tools of using technology to support their communities. Participants will leave with a brimming toolbox of open source tools, strategies, and a shareable understanding of how to support technology in their communities.
