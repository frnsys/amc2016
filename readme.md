## Fundraising

### Why?

"To make AMC more accessible to people who are essential to the awesomeness of your track, network, gathering, or practice space, who need some level of financial support in order to attend."

### What support AMP provides

- $550 minigrants
- fiscal sponsorship
- amp store (if you have fundraising products)
- flyer graphics
- promotion
- limited travel, housing & registration scholarship for presenters
- A/V & supplies for sessions
airport shuttle for presenters & coordinators
- registration for up to 6 members of your TPSNG coordinating team

### What the funds can be used for

- travel stipends for coordinators, volunteers and/or presenters
- food for mealtime meet-ups at the AMC
- housing stipends for coordinators, volunteers and/or presenters
- childcare costs for presenters or coordinators

### Fundraising Plan

#### What costs are you fundraising to cover?

- travel stipends for presenters

#### What is the minimum amount of $ that you would need to raise?  

- it depends on how many sessions (~ 10) we have in total and where the presenters are coming from.

#### What are two possible fundraising activities your coordinating team could do?

- crowdfunding (indiegogo) with newsrooms/media organizations
- design a t-shirt and sell it in the AMP store
- get some local event going on in portland to get portland's activists to AMC

#### Logistical considerations (How will you keep track of the funds? How will you distribute them?)
